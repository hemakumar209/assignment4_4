1. Use the package RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR.
data(RcmdrTestDrive)
and perform the below operations:
a. Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.
  Ans:
     >data1<-RcmdrTestDrive
     >head(data1)
     >fesal<-data1[data1$gender=="Female" , ]
     >fem<-data.frame(fesal$gender,fesal$salary,fesal$smoking)

     >masal<-data1[data1$gender=="Male" , ]
     >male<-data.frame(masal$gender,masal$salary,masal$smoking)  

    
     > mean(fesal$salary)#female average salary
       [1] 698.0911
     > mean(masal$salary)#male average salary
      [1] 743.3915




b. Which gender has the highest mean salary?
   Ans:
      male gendar has highest mean salary.
c. Report the highest mean salary.
   Ans:
      743.3915
d. Compare the spreads for the genders by calculating the standard deviation of salary by gender.

    Ans:
       To get the measures of spread you can use variance, 
            standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), 
                             minimum value, maximum value, 
                                                range etc.
     spread of salary for female gender

     > range(fem$fesal.salary)
      [1]  377.17 1025.09

      > sd(fem$fesal.salary)
      [1] 130.7053

      > mean(fesal$salary)   #center of spread of salary for female gender
       [1] 698.0911

     spread of salary for male gender

      > range(male$masal.salary)
       [1]  387.59 1156.16

      > sd(male$masal.salary)
       [1] 158.5423

      > mean(masal$salary)  #center of spread of salary for male gender
       [1] 743.3915
